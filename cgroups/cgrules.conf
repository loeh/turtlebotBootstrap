# /etc/cgrules.conf
#
#Each line describes a rule for a user in the forms:
#
#					
#:			
#
#Where:
#  can be:
#        - an user name
#        - a group name, with @group syntax
#        - the wildcard *, for any user or group.
#        - The %, which is equivalent to "ditto". This is useful for
#          multiline rules where different cgroups need to be specified
#          for various hierarchies for a single user.
#
#  is optional and it can be:
#	 - a process name
#	 - a full command path of a process
#
#  can be:
# 	 - comma separated controller names (no spaces)
# 	 - * (for all mounted controllers)
#
#  can be:
# 	 - path with-in the controller hierarchy (ex. pgrp1/gid1/uid1)
#
# Note:
# - It currently has rules based on uids, gids and process name.
#
# - Don't put overlapping rules. First rule which matches the criteria
#   will be executed.
#
# - Multiline rules can be specified for specifying different cgroups
#   for multiple hierarchies. In the example below, user "peter" has
#   specified 2 line rule. First line says put peter's task in test1/
#   dir for "cpu" controller and second line says put peter's tasks in
#   test2/ dir for memory controller. Make a note of "%" sign in second line.
#   This is an indication that it is continuation of previous rule.
